# NRLMOL basis set

This repository contains basis set used in the NRLMOL and FLOSIC software. 

**nrlmol.gbs** file contains the identical coefficients used in the NRLMOL ISYMGEN file. Extra basis is indicated with "Extrabasis" string next to the orbital type string. 

**nrlmol_coefadjusted.gbs** file constains contracted Gaussian coefficients adjusted by s-type: alpha**(-3/4), p-type: alpha**(-5/4), and d-type: alpha**(-7/4).
